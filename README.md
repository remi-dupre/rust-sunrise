**This is a fork of [nathan-osman][upstream]'s crate to test new features.**

This crate provides a function for calculating sunrise and sunset times using [this method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_equation#Complete_calculation_on_Earth).

### Usage

In order to perform the calculation, you'll need to provide the following:

- the date for which you wish to calculate the times
- the latitude and longitude of the location

Begin by adding this crate to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sunrise = "1.1"
```

You can `use` the `sunrise_sunset` function to perform the calculation:

```rust
// Calculate times for January 1, 2016 in Toronto
let (sunrise, sunset) = sunrise::sunrise_sunset(43.6532, -79.3832, 2016, 1, 1);
```

If you need more refined control, you can use the `SolarDay` struct:

```rust
use sunrise::{sunrise_sunset, SolarDay, SolarEvent, DawnType};

let dawn = SolarDay::new(43.6532, -79.3832, 2016, 1, 1)
    .with_altitude(54.)
    .event_time(SolarEvent::Dawn(DawnType::Civil));
```
